Remember to input your "ip-api.com" API key into ipcheck.php. Do have fun trying to set this up :p

This Tool utilizes a few services and libraries like:
https://ip-api.com/,
https://www.chartjs.org/,
https://github.com/zsxsoft/php-useragent,

TO DO:

- bootstrap a better dashboard so maps.php doesnt look so awful
- make Ringer easier to set up
- better documentation :p
